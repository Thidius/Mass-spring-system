# N-interconnected-mass-spring-system
A PyGame simulation of the motion over time for an interconnected mass-spring-system with n masses.
The user can input some initial conditions on the position of each mass. For each new input, a new mass is added into the system.
It's assumed that all masses are identical, and that they all start from rest. Through some mathematical derivation, the equations of motions are derived for each and every block. The solution of motion over time is then plotted, and after the window is closed, a PyGame simulation of the development of the system over time will be presented.
